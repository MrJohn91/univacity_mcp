## Future Enhancement Tasks 🔄

- [ ] 8. **Interactive Elicitation System**
  
  **What is Elicitation?** 
  Elicitation means "drawing out" or "getting" more specific information from users when their initial query is too vague or has multiple possible answers. Instead of guessing what the user wants, the system asks clarifying questions to understand their exact needs.
  
  **Example:** User says "I want to study Computer Science" → System finds 50+ CS programs → System asks "Which country/university/specialization?" → User clarifies → System gives precise results.

  - [ ] 8.1 **Clarification Tool Implementation**
    - Create `clarify_program` tool for handling ambiguous queries
    - Implement fuzzy matching for program names and fields of study
    - Add logic to detect when multiple options exist
    - Return structured clarification requests with numbered options
    - _Example: "Computer Science" → Shows multiple universities offering CS_

  - [ ] 8.2 **Multi-Step Conversation Support**
    - Add session/context management for follow-up questions
    - Implement state tracking for incomplete queries
    - Create response templates for clarification requests
    - Add support for user selection from provided options
    - _Flow: Query → Clarify → Select → Complete Response_

  - [ ] 8.3 **Smart Query Understanding**
    - Implement natural language processing for program field detection
    - Add synonym matching (e.g., "CS" = "Computer Science")
    - Create confidence scoring for query interpretation
    - Add fallback suggestions when no exact matches found
    - _Enhancement: Better understanding of user intent_

- [ ] 9. **Performance Optimization**
  - Add query result caching for frequently accessed data
  - Implement connection pooling for concurrent requests
  - Add database query performance monitoring
  - Optimize indexes based on actual usage patterns

- [ ] 10. **Enhanced Features**
  - Add more sophisticated ranking algorithms
  - Implement program comparison functionality
  - Add analytics and insights tools
  - Support for multiple languages and localization

- [ ] 11. **Multi-User Access System with Docker Deployment**
  
  **Current State:** MCP server runs locally, Claude Desktop accesses it locally - single user only.
  
  **Solution:** Deploy MCP server in accessible environment (Docker container) + FastAPI layer for multiple users.

  - [ ] 11.1 **Docker Containerization and Deployment**
    - Create Dockerfile for MCP server with PostgreSQL dependencies
    - Set up docker-compose.yml with MCP server + PostgreSQL + FastAPI services
    - Configure environment variables for database connections
    - Deploy to cloud VM or container service (AWS, GCP, Azure)
    - Ensure MCP server is accessible from FastAPI service
    - _Purpose: Make MCP server reachable for multiple clients_

  - [ ] 11.2 **FastAPI HTTP Layer**
    - Create FastAPI application as front-end layer
    - Implement REST endpoints that communicate with deployed MCP server:
      - `POST /programs/search` → calls MCP `programs_list` tool
      - `POST /programs/rank` → calls MCP `rank_programs` tool  
      - `GET /usage-guide` → accesses MCP `usage_guide` resource
    - Add request/response models using Pydantic
    - Handle MCP server communication (JSON-RPC over HTTP/TCP)
    - _Purpose: Accept HTTP requests from multiple web clients_

  - [ ] 11.3 **LLM Integration for Response Generation**
    - Choose and integrate an LLM API (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude API, etc.)
    - FastAPI receives MCP structured data and sends to LLM with prompts
    - Implement prompt engineering using existing `program_summary` template
    - Add error handling for API rate limits and failures
    - _Purpose: Generate natural language responses from MCP structured data_

  - [ ] 11.4 **Multi-User Architecture**
    - Implement session management for user conversations
    - Add concurrent request handling with proper connection pooling
    - Create request flow: User → FastAPI → MCP Server → Database → LLM → User
    - Add response caching for common queries
    - Add OAuth 2.0/JWT authentication for secure access control
    - Implement user registration and login endpoints
    - Add role-based access control (student, counselor, admin)
    - Implement rate limiting per user to prevent abuse
    - _Purpose: Handle multiple users simultaneously with consistent experience_

- [ ] 12. **Production Readiness**
  - Add comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Implement health checks and monitoring
  - Add automated testing suite
  - Create deployment documentation
  - Add authentication and rate limiting for multi-user access
  - Implement caching strategies for improved performance

## Development Commands

### Testing with MCP Inspector
```bash
uv run mcp dev ./src/server.py
```

### Production with Claude Desktop
```bash
uv --directory /Users/vee/Desktop/univacity_mcp run src/server.py
```

## Planned Feature: Interactive Elicitation System

### Example Scenario:
```
User: "I want to study Computer Science"

MCP Server Response:
{
  "clarification_needed": true,
  "message": "I found 15 Computer Science programs. Which aspect would you like to specify?",
  "options": {
    "by_country": ["United States (3 programs)", "United Kingdom (4 programs)", "Canada (2 programs)"],
    "by_institution": ["MIT", "Stanford", "Cambridge", "Oxford"],
    "by_specialization": ["AI/ML", "Software Engineering", "Data Science"]
  },
  "follow_up": "Please specify: country, institution, or specialization?"
}

User: "United Kingdom"

MCP Server Response:
{
  "programs": [
    {"name": "Computer Science BSc", "institution": "Cambridge", "tuition": 25000},
    {"name": "Computer Science MSc", "institution": "Oxford", "tuition": 28000}
  ],
  "clarification_complete": true
}
```

### Implementation Approach:
1. **Fuzzy Matching**: Detect partial matches in program names
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Determine when clarification is needed
3. **Structured Options**: Present choices in organized categories
4. **Context Preservation**: Remember previous selections in conversation
5. **Fallback Handling**: Suggest alternatives when no matches found

## Key Learnings from Development

1. **Data-First Approach**: Starting with data exploration was crucial for understanding the structure
2. **Incremental Loading**: Loading data in stages (countries → institutions → programs) handled dependencies well
3. **FastMCP Framework**: Simplified MCP protocol implementation significantly
4. **JSON-RPC Testing**: MCP Inspector was invaluable for debugging and validation
5. **Real Integration**: Claude Desktop integration validated the complete user experience

## Project Status: ✅ MVP Complete

- 2 Tools: `programs_list` and `rank_programs`
- 1 Resource: `usage_guide`
- 1 Prompt: `program_summary`
- Full Claude Desktop integration
- PostgreSQL backend with 5,969+ programs from 98+ institutions across 29+ countries
##
 Planned Feature: Multi-User Web Service

### Current vs Future Architecture:

**Current (Single User):**
```
User → Claude Desktop → MCP Server → PostgreSQL
```

**Future (Multi-User with Docker):**
```
Multiple Users → OAuth/JWT Auth → FastAPI (Container) → MCP Server (Container) → PostgreSQL (Container)
                                      ↓                           ↓
                                 LLM API                   Database Queries
                                      ↓                           ↓
                              Formatted Responses ← Structured Data
```

### Example Multi-User Flow:
```json
// User makes HTTP request
POST /programs/search
{
  "query": "Computer Science programs in Germany under €20000",
  "user_id": "user123"
}

// FastAPI processes request
1. Extract parameters from natural language query
2. Call internal programs_list tool
3. Get structured data from PostgreSQL
4. Send to LLM with program_summary prompt
5. Return formatted response

// Response to user
{
  "recommendations": "I found 8 Computer Science programs in Germany under €20,000. Here are the top 3 based on popularity and engagement...",
  "programs": [...],
  "total_found": 8,
  "session_id": "session456"
